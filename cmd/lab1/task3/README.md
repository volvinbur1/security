Add the ability to decipher any kind of poly alphabetic substitution ciphers. 
The one used in the cipher texts here has twenty-six independent randomly 
chosen mono alphabetic substitution patterns for each letter from english 
alphabet. It is clear that you can no longer relay on the same simple routine of
guessing the key by exhaustive search, which you probably used to decipher 
the previous paragraph, will the index of coincidence still work as a 
suggestion. You can try to divide the message in parts by the number of
characters in a key and apply frequency analysis to each of them. Can you 
find a way to use higher order frequency statistics with this type of 
cipher? The next magical word will take to the next lab. Enjoy bit.ly/2YJBlYL
